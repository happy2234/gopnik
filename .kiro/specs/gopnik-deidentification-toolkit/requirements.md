# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gopnik Deidentification Toolkit requires proper dependency management and documentation to ensure reliable installation and usage across different environments. Currently, users encounter import errors due to missing dependencies (like numpy) that are commented out in requirements.txt, and the project lacks comprehensive requirements and design documentation to guide future development and maintenance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer installing Gopnik, I want all required dependencies to be properly specified and installed, so that I can run the toolkit without encountering import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user installs gopnik via pip THEN all core dependencies SHALL be automatically installed
2. WHEN a user runs `gopnik --version` THEN the command SHALL execute successfully without ModuleNotFoundError
3. WHEN optional features are used THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about missing optional dependencies
4. IF a user wants AI functionality THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which additional packages need to be installed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to Gopnik, I want comprehensive requirements and design documentation, so that I can understand the system architecture and make informed changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reviews the project THEN they SHALL find complete requirements documentation in the spec
2. WHEN a developer needs to understand the architecture THEN they SHALL find a detailed design document
3. WHEN a developer wants to add features THEN they SHALL have clear guidance on system boundaries and interfaces
4. IF a developer needs to modify dependencies THEN they SHALL understand the impact on different deployment modes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator deploying Gopnik, I want flexible dependency management options, so that I can install only the components needed for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying CLI-only version THEN the system SHALL not require web or API dependencies
2. WHEN deploying web interface THEN the system SHALL include all necessary web framework dependencies
3. WHEN deploying with AI features THEN the system SHALL include all ML/AI dependencies
4. IF deploying without AI features THEN the system SHALL work with basic redaction capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user reading documentation, I want clear installation instructions for different use cases, so that I can set up Gopnik correctly for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads installation docs THEN they SHALL find instructions for basic, web, and AI installations
2. WHEN a user encounters dependency issues THEN they SHALL find troubleshooting guidance
3. WHEN a user wants to verify installation THEN they SHALL have clear verification steps
4. IF a user needs specific versions THEN they SHALL find version compatibility information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want proper dependency version constraints, so that I can ensure compatibility and security across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying dependencies THEN the system SHALL use appropriate version constraints
2. WHEN security updates are available THEN the system SHALL allow compatible updates
3. WHEN breaking changes occur in dependencies THEN the system SHALL prevent incompatible installations
4. IF development dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be clearly separated from runtime dependencies
